This web app provides detailed information about NCAA College Football Recruiting.
Have you ever wondered which schools are the most dominant in certain states when it comes to recruiting? Or are you curious as to which programs have been the most successful in recruiting a certain position within a certain state during a specific time period?

Using data from 2002-2020 from 247 Sports, this web app will allow the user to choose a state, position, star rating(according to 247), and a time period. The web app will then tell the user  the top 3 recruiting programs within that category, along with their best recruit from that category.

For example, one can see which schools are the best at recruiting 5-star wide receivers from Texas between 2010 and 2020. Or, one can see which schools recruited the best in Maryland this year amongst 4 star prospects and higher. The possibilities are endless and can uncover fascinating data about recruiting results.
